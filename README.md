# Overview

I created a timed coding quiz on JavaScript fundamentals, with multiple-choice questions. 

# Essential Criteria 

I have applied the essential criteria as follows:

* When I click the start button a timer starts and I am presented with a question 
* When I answer a question then I am presented with another question 
* Then, when I answer a question incorrectly, 2 seconds are subtracted from the clock
* When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over
* Then I can save my initials and score 


# Built With

In order to complete this challange, I applied the skills that I leard in the past week, such as variables, arrays, functions and while loops.
